#Credit Card Fraud Detection :

I have used this dataset for creating the dashboard https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/credit-card-fraud 

In this dataset I have mainly used creditcard and citylist table, I had to build a relationship using unique id in order to use longitutde and latitude value present in citylist and fraud and
amount of transaction column present in the creditcard table. In total there is 284,804 rows and 31 columns in the creditcard table. I have provided the snapshort and the power bi orignal template.
